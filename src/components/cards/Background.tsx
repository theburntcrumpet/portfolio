            <Text>Entering the field of technology in 2014 as a technical support apprentice for Axiomatic Technology Ltd, I didn't know where to expect my career to take me. Becoming increasingly intrigued about automating aspects of my role, I learned to program simple scripts in python to automate routine tasks.</Text>
            <Text>I began studying Computing & IT with The Open University in 2015, and by 2017 I was a Software Developer for Axiomatic Technology Ltd - developing back-end services in Python and C++.</Text>
            <Text>I left Axiomatic Technology at the end of 2019 to complete my degree. I had a temporary job as a IT Technician for P3 charity during this time. I graduated in 2020 with BSc Hons. First-Class.</Text>
